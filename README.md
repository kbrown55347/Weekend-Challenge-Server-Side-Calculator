# Server Side Calculator

## Description
---

Duration: 2 days

I created an application that takes in two numbers and performs a calculation.

To accomplish this, I first created a basic html application layout with two input fields, buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, an equals button, a 'C' button, an area to display the result from the current calculation and an area to display a list of previous calculations. I then added functionality on the client side to capture the input number values and which operation sign button was clicked on the click of the '=' button. I then wired that information to be bundled and sent to the server side. Next, on the server side, I created a function to perform a calculation based on the information that was received. Then I created a function to bundle the input numbers, operator and answer in an object and pushed that object to an array. I then wired that information to be sent to the client side and there I created a function to display the result of the current calculation and a history of all the previous calculations. Lastly, I created and wired a function on the client side to clear the input number fields on the click of the 'C' button.
